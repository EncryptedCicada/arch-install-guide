#These are my steps to achieve my personal setup

#Install an AUR helper like paru to help installing packages form AUR
cd /home/mamba/Downloads
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
cd paru-bin
makepkg -si
#Run the following command after the pervious process is completed
paru -gendb

#Edit /etc/pacman.conf and uncomment Color and append ILoveCandy

#Get necessary packages
paru -S reflector-simple timeshift-autosnap brave-bin gnome-tweaks chrome-gnome-shell ttf-jetbrains-mono bitwarden-bin gnome-software-packagekit-plugin power-profiles-daemon android-tools
#Now open and run reflector-simple and refresh mirrors

#Open timeshift and complete the initial setup

#To setup plymouth:
paru -S plymouth-git gdm-plymouth
#Append plymouth to the HOOKS in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf after base and udev for it to function
sudo nvim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
******example
HOOKS=(base udev plymouth ...)
******
#Install extra plymouth themes from AUR, for example:
paru -S plymouth-theme-sweet-arch-git
#See all installed themes with:
plymouth-set-default-theme -l
#Change the default theme(spinner) with something else by editing the plymouthd.conf located in /etc/plymouth/ to your theme listed by the previous command:
sudo nvim /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
******example
[Daemon]
Theme=plymouth-theme-sweet-arch
ShowDelay=0
DeviceTimeout=8
******
#initrd must be regenerated after changing the theme for it to take affect with the following command (change apple-mac-plymouth to the theme you're setting):
sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R plymouth-theme-sweet-arch
NOTE: On systems that boot quickly, you may only see a flicker of your splash theme before your DM or login prompt is ready. You can set ShowDelay to an interval (in seconds) longer than your boot time to prevent this flicker and only show a blank screen.

#To add and work with extensions on gnome
#First install the native connector for extentions to work with:
paru -S chrome-gnome-shell
#Add extension to chrome/chromium based browsers like brave from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep
#Go to extentions.gnome.org to add extentions to gnome
#My personally curated extensions (add one at a time and click install when prompted):
1. blur-my-shell
2. just-perfection
3. espresso
#Visit github pages of respective extensions to know more
