#Open timeshift and complete the initial setup

#Theming specific steps ahead

#To theme the gnome desktop install a gtk theme
$ paru -S sweet-gtk-theme sweet-gtk-theme-dark

#To set the newly installed theme open 'Gnome Tweaks' and go to appearance tab and change the applications and shell themes to your liking.
#There might be an exclamation mark in front of shell theme dropdown and that can be taken care of by enabling the User Themes extension within the Extensions app.

#To setup plymouth:
$ paru -S plymouth-git gdm-plymouth
#Append plymouth to the HOOKS in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf after base and udev for it to function
$ sudo nvim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
******example
HOOKS=(base udev plymouth ...)
******
#Install extra plymouth themes from AUR, for example:
$ paru -S plymouth-theme-sweet-arch-git
#See all installed themes with:
$ plymouth-set-default-theme -l
#Change the default theme(spinner) with something else by editing the plymouthd.conf located in /etc/plymouth/ to your theme listed by the previous command:
$ sudo nvim /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
******example
[Daemon]
Theme=sweet-arch
ShowDelay=0
DeviceTimeout=8
******
#initrd must be regenerated after changing the theme for it to take affect with the following command (change apple-mac-plymouth to the theme you're setting):
$ sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R sweet-arch
NOTE: On systems that boot quickly, you may only see a flicker of your splash theme before your DM or login prompt is ready. You can set ShowDelay to an interval (in seconds) longer than your boot time to prevent this flicker and only show a blank screen.

#To add and work with extensions on gnome
#First install the native connector for extentions to work with:
$ paru -S chrome-gnome-shell
#Add extension to chrome/chromium based browsers like brave from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep
#Go to extentions.gnome.org to add extentions to gnome
#My personally curated extensions (add one at a time and click install when prompted):
1. blur-my-shell
2. just-perfection
3. espresso
#Visit github pages of respective extensions to know more
