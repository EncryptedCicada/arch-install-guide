#Open timeshift and complete the initial setup

#To setup plymouth:
paru -S plymouth-git gdm-plymouth
#Append plymouth to the HOOKS in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf after base and systemd for it to function
sudo nvim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
#The resulting line should look like:
...
HOOKS=(base systemd plymouth ...)
...

#Install extra plymouth themes from AUR, for example:
paru -S plymouth-theme-sweet-arch-git
#See all installed themes with:
plymouth-set-default-theme -l
#Change the default theme(spinner) with something else by editing the plymouthd.conf located in /etc/plymouth/ to your theme listed by the previous command:
sudo nvim /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf
#Example setup can be like:
...
[Daemon]
Theme=sweet-arch
ShowDelay=0
DeviceTimeout=8
...
#initrd must be regenerated after changing the theme for it to take affect with the following command
#change 'sweet-arch' to the theme you're setting:
sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R sweet-arch
NOTE: On systems that boot quickly, you may only see a flicker of your splash theme before your DM or login prompt is ready.
#You can set ShowDelay to an interval (in seconds) longer than your boot time to prevent this flicker and only show a blank screen.

#To add and work with extensions on gnome
#First install the native connector for extentions to work with:
paru -S chrome-gnome-shell
#Install the extension-manager app (recommended):
paru -S extension-manager

#Alternatively you can do the following:
#Add extension to chrome/chromium based browsers like brave from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep
#Go to extentions.gnome.org to add extentions to gnome
#My personally curated extensions (add one at a time and click install when prompted):
1. blur-my-shell
2. just-perfection
3. espresso
4. Vitals
#Visit github pages of respective extensions to know more
